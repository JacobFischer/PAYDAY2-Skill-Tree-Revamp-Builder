# PAYDAY 2 Skill Tree Revamp Builder
A quick tool to test builds with the new revamped PAYDAY2 Skill Trees

This is a simple HTML+JS+CSS website. You just need something to serve it to your webbrowser.

Because 99% of people won't want to jump through that hoop I'm hosting the most recent versions here:

[payday.drakendomain.net](http://payday.drakendomain.net/)

It is very possible there are spelling errors in the skills' descriptions. I used a combination of manual transcribing and OCR to get the text from the images Overkill provided. If you are so inclined I would love pull requests fixing those errors.
